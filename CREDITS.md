# Credits, Notes, and Reference

  + [Exploratory Python repo](https://github.com/data-creative/law-schools-py)
  + [ABA Schools Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/data-creative/law-schools-py/master/data/schools.json)
  + [Alternate ABA Schools Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/data-creative/law-schools-py/master/data/schools_alt.json) - this version has UUIDs, but no matching identifier to tie them to the other file, so perhaps some kind of name and/or order matching can be done (later). for now domains can serve as the school's unique identifiers - they are more contextual than numbers anyway.
  + [Selenium WebDriver Docs/ example usage for Ruby](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Ruby-Bindings#api-example)
